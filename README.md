The neurobagel documentation.

Our docs are built with the [Material Theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) for [MKdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).


## Setup
Create a new virtual environment with `python -m venv venv` and activate it.
Then install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Build
